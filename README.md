# Genetic algorithm 

A [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) is a metaheuristic inspired by Darwin's evolutionism.

Genetic algorithms are used to find a close-to-optimal solution among a pool of candidate solutions. They are almost ubiquitous in optimization problems, with applications ranging from natural sciences to finance.

An application in a quantum information context can be found at [nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-14680-7)

The steps involved are:

+ Randomly initiate a population of candidate solutions
1. Perform crossing-over between candidates
2. Perform mutations
3. Evaluating the fitness of the candidates
4. Select the best individuals
5. Repeat until you convergence has reached
