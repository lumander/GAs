# Genetic algorithm for learning an image

This module performs a genetic algorithm for learning an image.
In this particular case, I have chosen an image representing Microsoft's logo. 

### Implementation 

### Quickstart

```python
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 ImageLearning.py '{"pop_size":10, "pathToImage":"image-learning/Microsoft.jpg", "max_gen":100000}'
```
It is compatible with python 2.7 hence you can easily run it with pip and python
