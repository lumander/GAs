# Genetic algorithm for learning an image

This module performs a [genetic algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) for learning an unknown image.
It is a machine learning tecnique inspired by Darwin's evolutionism.

Genetic algorithm is used to find a close-to-optimal solution among a pool of candidate solutions
