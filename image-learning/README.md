# Genetic algorithm for learning an image

This module performs a [genetic algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm) for learning an unknown image.
It is a metaheuristic inspired by Darwin's evolutionism.

Genetic algorithm is used to find a close-to-optimal solution among a pool of candidate solutions

The steps involved are:

+ Randomly initiate a population of candidate solutions
1. Perform crossing-over between candidates
2. Perform mutations
3. Evaluating the fitness of the candidates
4. Select the best individuals
5. Repeat until you convergence has reached
